/* bulk-client.c
 * NOTE: The following isn't true. It is the plan.
 *
 * $ bulk-client ipaddr nclients startaddr timeout
 *    ipaddr    - IP address of the multicast listener
 *    nclients  - number of clients to run
 *    startaddr - IP address for the first client
 *    timeout   - timeout for the transmit trigger in ms
 *
 * Binds the multicast listener to ipaddr.
 *
 * Starts up nclients threads running acting like multicast clients. Each
 * needs its own IP address. The addresses used are startaddr counting up.
 * So, when nclients is 5 and startaddr is 192.168.0.5, the addresses used
 * are: 192.168.0.5 .. 192.168.0.9. These addresses should exist.
 *
 * Triggers the multicast ever timeout ms.
